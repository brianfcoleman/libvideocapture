Build instructions
I compiled this library using Visual Studio 2008

1. Download boost. I used version 1.44.0
2. Download SDL. I used version 1.2.14
3. Extract boost and SDL in the same directory as the libvideocapture repository
   i.e. you should have a folder structure like this
   a_path_to_a_directory\libvideocapture
   a_path_to_a_directory\SDL-1.2.14
   a_path_to_a_directory\boost_1_44_0
4. Copy libvideocapture\VisualC to SDL-1.2.14\VisualC
   This allows building a version of SDL which is linked against the static c
   runtime.
5. To build the test application open a visual studio command prompt
6. cd to a_path_to_a_directory\libvideocapture
7. run nmake test
   This should build boost and sdl first and then the test application
8. The test application also invokes nmake videocapture_static
   This leaves libvideocapture\lib\libvideocapture_static.lib
   This is a lib which you can link against when compiling against the source
   files in libvideocapture\src\videocapture. It is linked against the static
   c runtime.
   If you want a libvideocapture compiled against the dynamic c runtime
   then run nmake videocapture
9. The test application also invokes nmake sdlmanager_static
   This leaves libvideocapture\lib\libsdlmanager_static.lib
   This is a lib which you can link against when compiling against the source
   files in libvideocapture\src\sdl. It is linked against the static
   c runtime.
   If you want a libsdlmanager compiled against the dynamic c runtime
   then run nmake sdlmanager
10. The files in libvideocapture\src\videocapture provide an interface to
   the system's video capture devices such as webcams using direct show
11.The files in libvideocapture\src\sdl provide a means to use sdl to
   render the output of video capture devices. The sdl objects must run on
   the main thread of the application.
12.The test application provides a way to create a multithreaded media processing
   pipeline which takes the output of a video device, rotates it if it is
   upside down and renders it to a window.
13.VideoCaptureDeviceManager gives a list of VideoCaptureDevice's. It manages
   the devices and cleans up after them.
   A VideoCaptureDevice has a list of supported RGBVideoFormat's which can be set.
   Call startCapturing to start capturing.
14.If you want to use different names for the boost and SDL directories,
   these can be changed in the Makefile. Just change BOOST_ROOT and/or SDL_ROOT
